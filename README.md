# doppelganger

- When the game starts, NPCs are generated in each of the 8 rooms. 
- Each NPC has a name and a destination room.
- At the beginning, one of the 8 NPCs is a 'doppelganger', and the name is the same as one of the remaining 7 NPCs.
- If an NPC with the same name meets a doppelganger, it is game over. And you will return to the main menu.
- You can check the name and the route to the destination by clicking mouse on the NPCs.
- Light gray is an open door, dark gray is a closed door. Click to toggle.
- The doppelgangers have part of their names hidden. And Doppelgangers spawn in random rooms at regular intervals.

- Once the NPCs reach the destination room, they will decide on a new destination room.
- Each NPC judges the status of the doors in the entire map differently and tracks the shortest path to the destination room, 
and when the NPC discovers a new door that is open or closed, the optimized path is recalculated 
(you can check the status of the doors in the map from the NPC's perspective by clicking on the NPC also).
- The doppelgangers have different names when they reach the destination room.

- 'Find' the doppelgangers, guess its name, remember them, and 'protect' the NPCs by opening and closing the doors at the right time!
